NZ.js talk submission
=====================

# Title
W.W.E.D. (What would Ember.js do?)

# Summary
What would Ember.js look like if it was a server side framework?
This talk will explore this idea as well as some key framework design related 
concepts such as inversion of control and extensibility, all illustrated with 
code from a new Ember inspired Node.js framework we've been working on called Ash.

# Description
After identifying a number of pain points in our current backend stack we began to 
ask ourselves questions such as "how can we be more productive?" 
and "how could our developer experience be improved?" 

As Ember.js developers we see the benefits of well thought out and consistent APIs as well as 
strong conventions. This lead me to wonder what a Node.js based server side framework that was heavily 
inspired by Ember might look like. From there "Ash" arose.

In this talk I will explore some of the big ideas behind framework design.
I'll talk core concepts such as "inversion of control" and "extensibility" and then go 
on to discuss some of our philosophical goals for Ash such as "convention over configuration", 
"consistent APIs" and "developer productivity". Along the way I'll share code and try to convince 
you that an Ember flavoured server side framework does indeed make good sense.

# Notes
I'm the main author of the Ash framework and I'm going to use my recent experience 
building this framework to talk about both the specifics and more general concepts 
relating to framework design. Ash itself is a pretty new endeavor so we are 
right in the thick of things building it. It's still a long way off anything production 
ready but we think it's pretty exciting and that it has a lot of potential.

I'm hoping many of the ideas and concepts I'm going to talk about will appeal to a wider audience as well as hardcore Ember.js developers.
